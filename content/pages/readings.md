## Required Textbooks

\[P&S\] = Peskin, Michael E., and Daniel V. Schroeder. *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*. CRC Press, 1995. ISBN: 9780201503975.                      
(A comprehensive and pedagogical treatment of QFT starting from the basics and reaching up to the physics of the standard model)

\[SW\] = Weinberg, Steven. *The Quantum Theory of Fields, Volume 1: Foundations.* Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN: 9780521670531.                      
(A comprehensive and insightful treatment of the foundations of QFT)

## Recommended Books

Zee, A. *Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell*. Princeton University Press, 2003. ISBN: 9780691010199.             
(A fun book that deals briefly with many of the key ideas and uses of QFT)

Srednicki, Mark. *Quantum Field Theory*. Cambridge University Press, 2007.  ISBN: 9780521864497.            
(Very readable and comprehensive. Structured somewhat differently from this course. Part I (spin 0) and Part II (spin 1/2) are available at [Quantum Field Theory: Spin Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0409035) and [Quantum Field Theory: Spin One Half](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0409036).)

Banks, Tom. *Modern Quantum Field Theory: A Concise Introduction*. Cambridge University Press, 2008. ISBN: 9780521850827.   
(Modern, insightful treatment of many important topics)

Schwartz, Matthew. *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model*. Cambridge University Press, 2013. ISBN: 9781107034730.   
(A well-written introduction to QFT that emphasizes physical intuition alongside calculations. Self-contained, and covers both canonical quantization and the path integral approach.)

Brown, Lowell S. *Quantum Field Theory*. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1994. ISBN: 9780521469463.        
(A modern path integral presentation of QFT. Covers QED but not QCD.)

Ramond, Pierre. *Field Theory: A Modern Primer* (second edition). Levant Books, 2007. ISBN: 9788187169840.      
(A book dealing efficiently with QFT in the path integral approach)

Ryder, Lewis. *Quantum Field Theory* (second edition). Cambridge University Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780521478144.  
(A modern pedagogical introduction to QFT including the Weinberg-Salam model and other selected topics)

Mandl, Franz and Graham Shaw. *Quantum Field Theory.* John Wiley & Sons, 1984. ISBN: 9780471906506.  
(A clear and concise introduction to the basic computations in quantum field theory)
