## Required Textbook

Peskin, Michael E., and Daniel V. Schroeder. *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*. CRC Press, 1995. ISBN: 9780201503975.             
(A comprehensive and pedagogical treatment of QFT starting from the basics and reaching up to the physics of the standard model)

Weinberg, Steven. *The Quantum Theory of Fields, Volume 1: Foundations.* Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN: 9780521670531.             
(A comprehensive and insightful treatment of the foundations of QFT)

## Recommended Books

Zee, A. *Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell*. Princeton University Press, 2003. ISBN: 9780691010199.    
(A fun book that deals briefly with many of the key ideas and uses of QFT)

Srednicki, Mark. *Quantum Field Theory*. Cambridge University Press, 2007.  ISBN: 9780521864497.   
(Very readable and comprehensive. Structured somewhat differently from this course. Part I (spin 0) and Part II (spin 1/2) are available at arXiv:hep-th/0409035 and arXiv:hep-th/0409036.)

T. Banks, Modern Quantum Field theory: a concise introduction, Cambridge University Press (2008). Modern, insightful treatment of many important topics.

M. Schwartz, Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model, Cambridge University Press (2013). A well-written introduction to QFT that emphasizes physical intuition alongside calculations. Self-contained, and covers both canonical quantization and the path integral approach.

Lowell S. Brown, Quantum Field Theory, Cambridge University Press (1992). A modern path integral presentation of QFT. Covers QED but not QCD.

P. Ramond, Field Theory: A Modern Primer (second edition), Addison Wesley (1990).  
(A book dealing e ciently with QFT in the path integral approach.)

L. Ryder, Quantum Field Theory (second edition), Cambridge University Press (1996). A modern pedagogical introduction to QFT including the Weinberg-Salam model and other selected topics.

F. Mandl and G. Shaw, Quantum Field Theory, John Wiley & Sons (1984). A clear and concise introduction to the basic computations in quantum  eld theory.
