## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week; 1 hour / session

## Prerequisite

You must complete [*8.321 Quantum Theory I*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-321-quantum-theory-i-fall-2017/) before attempting this course.

## Description

*Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I* is a one-term self-contained subject in quantum field theory.

## Topics

### The Klein-Gordon Field

- Noether's theorem
- The energy-momentum tensor
- Particle creation by a classical source
- The Casimir effect
- Fields as operator-valued distributions

### The Dirac Field

- Dirac matrices
- Dirac bilinear operators
- Lorentz transformations for spin-½ particles and fields
- Discrete symmetries of the Dirac field

### Interacting Fields

- Time-dependent perturbation theory
- Wick's theorem
- Feynman diagrams
- Cross sections and decay rates
- Wigner's representation theorem

## Required Textbook

## Grading

There is no exam for this course. The course grade will be based 100% on homework. The faculty may alter grades to reflect class participation, improvement, effort and other qualitative measures of performance.

## Homework Policy

There will normally be one problem set each week, due one week later in lecture. After attempting each problem by yourself, we encourage you to discuss the problems with the teaching staff and with each other — this is an excellent way to learn physics! However, you must write up your solutions by yourself.
